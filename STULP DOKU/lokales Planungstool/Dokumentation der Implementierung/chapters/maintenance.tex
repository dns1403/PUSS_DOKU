\section{Practical maintenance of the web tool}
This chapter focuses on detail of maintaining the tool practically, how to start and shut-down, build or compile after updating or extending the source code.

%\subsection{The address (location) of the currently used virtual machine}
%Currently there are three instances of the web program set up, all of them are hosted at the Informatik Rechnerbetrieb (IRB). One is for computer science, its root account accessible for every user of the IMT-LDAP group "stulp" via SSH. There's another instance on this machine, "stulp-dev", which is designed for testing and regularly reset automatically.\\
%All of the machines check every 15 minutes for a new commit in the git and update in that case. All of them take care of the master branch but the stulp-dev uses the develop-branch.\\
%\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
%	Instance   & Frontend URL                  & API URL                           & SSH address     \\ \hline
%	stulp      & https://stulp.cs.upb.de/      & https://stulp-api.cs.upb.de/      & stulp.cs.upb.de \\
%	stulp-dev  & https://stulp-dev.cs.upb.de/  & https://stulp-dev-api.cs.upb.de/  & stulp.cs.upb.de \\
%	stulp-math & https://stulp-math.cs.upb.de/ & https://stulp-math-api.cs.upb.de/ &                 \\
%	stulp-et   & https://stulp-et.cs.upb.de/   & https://stulp-et-api.cs.upb.de/   &
%\end{tabular}

%\subsection{The currently used versions of web server, web server backend, sqlite database, …}
%That's a Debian with Apache web server, Java and SQlite. For Details see the installation guide\footnote{https://git.cs.upb.de/stulp.imt/installation\_guide}

\subsection{The current location of source codes, makefiles, executables of the web too and the local planning tool build files to}
All source files and building scripts are located in git\footnote{https://git.cs.upb.de/stulp.imt/web\_program}. The script for automatic building and deploying on the web server can be found on another repository\footnote{https://git.cs.upb.de/stulp.imt/web\_configs}.

\subsection{How does (or doesn’t) your software interoperate with the software generated by Jan-Philipp, Nils, and Monika}
It's working absolutely fine with our adaption of Jan-Philipp's tool. It should also work with the original version, beside the integration for the work flow isn't existing here and the database needs to be down- and uploaded manually.\\
As tested it works fine with Monika's tool. Here also the down- and upload needs to be done manually and isn't integrated to the tool itself.\\
Unfortionally it's incompatible to Nils's tool. The reason in this case is, our tools uses LDAP for authorizing users and therefore uses the IMT-Names of persons for users and Prof-IDs. Nils tool uses an own naming schema here and doesn't use the LDAP-names.
