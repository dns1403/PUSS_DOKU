\section{Overview of the local planning tool}
This section aims to help future developers modify the "Local Program" system according to changing requirements and set up a productive tool again. It also includes instructions on how to modify the software, how to build a new version of the software, and the database schemas with the meaning of the attributes and their values.

The code for the local planning tool is split into two repositories. The database code is excluded from the rest and can be found here: \href{https://git.cs.uni-paderborn.de/stulp/sven_database}{https://git.cs.uni-paderborn.de/stulp/sven\_database}. The main code for the tool can be found at: \href{https://git.cs.uni-paderborn.de/stulp/sven_local_program}{https://git.cs.uni-paderborn.de/stulp/sven\_local\_program}.
